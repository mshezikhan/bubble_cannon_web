<h1>Bubble Cannon</h1>
It's a fun and fast-paced game ⚡, where a target number (target pressure) appears on a panel 🎯, while the cannon displays a random number (cannon pressure) 💥. When both numbers match, quickly shoot a bubble 🫧! But be careful ⚠️—if the numbers don’t match and you shoot, you lose a life 💔. Keep shooting 🔫, but act fast ⏱️ to stay alive and score higher 🏆!
